# StackOverflow-Lite

StackOverflow-Lite is a simplified version of the popular Q&A platform, Stack Overflow. This project allows users to ask questions, provide answers, and vote on the best answers. It’s designed as a hands-on way to learn about web development using ASP.NET Core, database management, and user authentication.

## 🚀 Features

- **User Registration and Authentication**: Users can register, log in, and manage their accounts securely.
- **Question & Answer Posting**: Users can ask questions and provide answers.
- **Voting System**: Upvote or downvote questions and answers to highlight the best content.

- **Database**: Entity Framework Core with SQL Server

The project is structured to follow clean architecture principles, separating concerns between backend and frontend development. Key directories include:

- `/Controllers` - ASP.NET Core controllers for managing requests
- `/Models` - Entity classes for database interaction
- `/Views` - Razor views for rendering HTML
- `/wwwroot` - Static assets such as CSS, JavaScript, and images
